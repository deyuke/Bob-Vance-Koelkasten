# Bob Vance Koelkasten (Bob Vance Refrigerators)
This is a project I made in 4 days for school. I had to make a (not fully functional) webshop and CRUD system. The page is in Dutch, because my school is in the Netherlands, but of course I can also make it in English. 

## How to use 
What you'll need:
* Apache (for running PHP websites)
* A MySQL database (eg: PhpMyAdmin)

I recommend installing [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html), this is an all-in-one package which includes both of the above services. 

Clone the repository in the htdocs directory in the XAMPP root directory, then run XAMPP to enable PhpMyAdmin and Apache.

Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and make a new user with all permissions. Then navigate to the SQL tab and copy all the code from the ```import.sql``` file and paste it in the query field. The database is now set up.

After following the steps above, navigate to 
http://localhost/ (name of the cloned repository) /index.php
